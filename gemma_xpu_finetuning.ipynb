    "In this notebook, you will learn how to fine-tune a large language model (Google's Gemma) using Intel Max Series GPUs (XPUs) for a specific task. The notebook covers the following key points:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Setting up the environment and optimizing it for Intel GPUs\n",
    "2. Initializing the XPU and configuring LoRA settings for efficient fine-tuning\n",
    "3. Loading the pre-trained Gemma model and testing its performance\n",
    "4. Preparing a diverse dataset of question-answer pairs covering various domains\n",
    "5. Fine-tuning the model using the Hugging Face `Trainer` class\n",
    "6. Evaluating the fine-tuned model on a test dataset\n",
    "7. Saving and loading the fine-tuned model for future use\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "The notebook demonstrates how fine-tuning can enhance a model's performance on a diverse range of topics, making it more versatile and applicable to various domains. You will gain insights into the process of creating a **task-specific model** that can provide accurate and relevant responses to a wide range of questions.\n",

    "It's time to finetune our Gemma model! We'll use the SFTTrainer class from the trl library, which is designed for supervised fine-tuning of language models. We'll specify the training arguments, such as batch size, learning rate, and evaluation strategy. 📈\n",
    "\n",
    "Supervised fine-tuning (SFT) is a powerful technique for adapting pre-trained language models to specific tasks. By providing the model with question-answer pairs from the Databricks Dolly 15k dataset, we can guide it to generate more accurate and relevant responses. SFT allows the model to learn the patterns and relationships specific to the diverse range of topics covered in the dataset. 🎓\n",
    "\n",
    "By focusing on the \"Question answering\" category, we can leverage the rich information available in the Dolly dataset to enhance our model's ability to provide informative and contextually appropriate responses. The model will learn to understand the nuances and intricacies of various question types and generate answers that are coherent and relevant. 💡\n",
    "\n",
    "We'll also enable experiment tracking with Weights & Biases (wandb) to monitor our training progress and visualize the results. This will give us valuable insights into how the model is improving over time and help us make informed decisions during the fine-tuning process. 📊"
